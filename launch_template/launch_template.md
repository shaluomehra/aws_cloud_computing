![Screenshot 2023-10-06 134536.png](Screenshot%202023-10-06%20134536.png)

Open the left panel, and click 'Launch Templates' and then click 'Create New Template'

This will direct you to page which looks a lot like when you create an instance. <br>

1. Fill out the necessary fields with correct naming techniques
2. Load up the AMI that has the App ready to be deployed (I've used Luke's since I haven't got mine ready)
3. Fill in the necessary user details (Check how_create_dashboard.md if you don't know how)
4. Give an appropriate tag to the launch template

5. Once this is done we can 'Launch instance from template'
